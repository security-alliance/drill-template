# Live Scenario Documentation


## Context

### Goals

Organize and conduct a series of drills to help protocol teams prepare for attacks and dependency failures in order to test both **social** and **technical** resiliency, harden internal procedures for deployment & recovery, and develop a training program for team members.

After going through these drills the team will be able to understand:

- What are the key dependencies of the protocol and what happens if they fail?
- Is there sufficient monitoring infra to detect & respond to failures?
- Is there an understanding of who has access to admin keys and how & when they are accessed to respond to threats?
- Do essential team members have backup people in place who can respond if they are unavailable?
- Does the team know who to contact in other protocols if a failure is detected?

### Stakeholders

All team members are welcome in the exercise with duties related to:

- Notification & reporting infrastructure for application state & dependencies
- Smart contract developers
- FE development & interface hosting
- Communications

### Vision

Throughout these exercises we will develop a suite of open source tools that teams will be able to use for future exercises and training new team members.

### Scenario

We simulate a failure within the Compound protocol on a fork of Ethereum Mainnet. We will gather protocol devs and partners in a simulated war room to diagnose the problem, develop and action plan, and implement the recovery procedure. The failure mode is not be communicated in advance and the team will have to use the forked network to figure out the problem and respond.

## üß™ Network Fork

The network fork runs in docker on a Digital Ocean droplet. The docker compose file here sets up a local anvil node and explorer.

![Screen Shot 2023-07-04 at 9.57.19 PM.png](assets/Screen_Shot_2023-07-04_at_9.57.19_PM.png)

[https://github.com/ipatka/blockscout/blob/anvil/docker-compose/docker-compose-anvil.yml](https://github.com/ipatka/blockscout/blob/anvil/docker-compose/docker-compose-anvil.yml)

The network fork also runs an nginx proxy to forward requests on the *****/rpc/***** route to the local anvil node

Block explorer: [https://securityalliance.dev/](https://securityalliance.dev/)

RPC (include trailing slash, idk why): [https://securityalliance.dev/rpc/](https://securityalliance.dev/rpc/)

### ‚õë Health Scripts

`restartFoundry.sh`

Checks if anvil node & blockscout api are alive. If not, restarts the docker container

[https://github.com/ipatka/blockscout/blob/anvil/scripts/restartFoundry.sh](https://github.com/ipatka/blockscout/blob/anvil/scripts/restartFoundry.sh)

Runs on a [cron](https://www.notion.so/Configuration-Notes-8b710b4130224b998c5628136709ea17?pvs=21) job every 5 minutes

Anvil sometimes freezes and has to be restarted. Perhaps need pruning

`syncBlockTime.sh`

Compares fork time to mainnet time and sets fork time to mainnet time. Useful when fork falls behind mainnet to keep block explorer times up to date

Runs on a [cron](https://www.notion.so/Configuration-Notes-8b710b4130224b998c5628136709ea17?pvs=21) job every 5 minutes

[https://github.com/ipatka/sec-alliance-sims/blob/main/script/sh/syncBlockTime.sh](https://github.com/ipatka/sec-alliance-sims/blob/main/script/sh/syncBlockTime.sh)

### üìì Scripts

`Verify Contracts`

Fetch deployment blocks & source code for contracts you want to verify:

[https://github.com/ipatka/sec-alliance-sims/blob/main/script/ts/fetchDeploymentBlocks.ts](https://github.com/ipatka/sec-alliance-sims/blob/main/script/ts/fetchDeploymentBlocks.ts)

Submit them to blockscout:

[https://github.com/ipatka/sec-alliance-sims/blob/main/script/ts/verifyBlockscout.ts](https://github.com/ipatka/sec-alliance-sims/blob/main/script/ts/verifyBlockscout.ts)

****NOTE**** Deployment blocks of mainnet contracts you want to verify must be indexed by blockscout. See notes

### üìã Configuration notes

- Digital ocean with 300GB DB should be sufficient
- Install direnv on the droplet ***and*** your local env for testing
- Mainnet RPC URL with *****a lot***** of capacity & concurrent request support (10M requests per day, 20 concurrent)
- [Install and configure nginx proxy](https://www.notion.so/Configuration-Notes-8b710b4130224b998c5628136709ea17?pvs=21)
- Install foundry on droplet
- [Allow firewall rules for docker bridge & network](https://www.notion.so/Configuration-Notes-8b710b4130224b998c5628136709ea17?pvs=21)
- Configure the indexer to start indexing one block after the fork
- Configure the indexer to index the block ranges for contract deployments that you want to verify

**********If flash loan is not WETH it sells remaining profit for WETH at the end so it can be withdrawn**********

## üì° Forta Node

The forta node runs in local standalone mode in a docker on a Digital Ocean droplet. The docker compose file here sets up a forta node, the monitoring bots, and a notification server to push alerts to discord and telegram

[https://github.com/ipatka/forta-node/blob/secalliance/docker-compose/standalone/docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/ipatka/forta-node/blob/secalliance/docker-compose/standalone/docker-compose.yml)

### ü§ñ Monitoring Bots

**********Oracle Bot:********** [https://github.com/ipatka/compound-monitoring/tree/comet/oracle-price-monitor](https://github.com/ipatka/compound-monitoring/tree/comet/oracle-price-monitor)

Standard bot running on mainnet. This bot detects when the validator for the price aggregator rejects a price. **Note the price is still transmitted on chain and becomes the valid price for compound, it just emits an event which triggers the bot**

The validator checks the Uniswap price

Example:

WETH price feed: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419)

WETH aggregator: [https://etherscan.io/address/0xE62B71cf983019BFf55bC83B48601ce8419650CC#readContract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xE62B71cf983019BFf55bC83B48601ce8419650CC#readContract)

WETH validator: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x264BDDFD9D93D48d759FBDB0670bE1C6fDd50236](https://etherscan.io/address/0x264BDDFD9D93D48d759FBDB0670bE1C6fDd50236)

Rejection example: [https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd9704bef01b010eeb55bc6cb9216b6df765ce59143daca911168efb72f861a0d#eventlog](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd9704bef01b010eeb55bc6cb9216b6df765ce59143daca911168efb72f861a0d#eventlog)

**********Market Bot**********: [https://github.com/ipatka/compound-monitoring/tree/comet/comet-monitor](https://github.com/ipatka/compound-monitoring/tree/comet/comet-monitor)

Custom bot which looks for supply and withdraw events from Comet
