## Drill Goals

In this first exercise, we will discuss scenarios in which the core teams needs to detect, diagnose, and respond to a variety of issues. We will gather the core decision-makers together to decide what actions should be taken, and what should be communicated. This exercise will be discussion-based and will not involve any real actions that need to be taken.

The goal of the exercise is to prepare for attacks and dependency failures in order to test both social and technical resiliency, harden internal procedures for deployment & recovery, and develop a training program for team members.

After going through this drill the team will be able to understand:

- What are the key dependencies of the protocol and what happens if they fail?
- Is there sufficient monitoring infra to detect & respond to failures?
- Is there an understanding of who has access to admin keys and how & when they are accessed to respond to threats?
- Do essential team members have backup people in place who can respond if they are unavailable?
- Does the team know who to reach out to in other protocols if a failure is detected?

## Stakeholders

All team members are welcome in the exercise with duties related to:

- Notification & reporting infrastructure for application state & dependencies
- Smart contract developers
- FE development & interface hosting
- Communications

## Tabletop Script

Since the incident response will change as upgrades are made to the protocol, letâ€™s discuss these scenarios as if they happened today.

---

**Scenario 1:** 

*Phase 1 - discovery of the issue*

What monitoring infrastructure alerted the team to the issue?

*Phase 1a - Gather stakeholders*

Did the team know who to ask for help in this situation?

*Phase 2 - Analyze the issue and develop a response plan*

Did the team have an existing playbook for what to do?

*Phase 3 - Implement the response plan*

Who took action and what did they do?

*Phase 4 - Reflection*

What could have gone better?
